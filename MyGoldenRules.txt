My golden rules=


1)A class in java can inherit any other class using the keyword extends(Simple Inheritance)

2)All members of the superclass are inherited in the subclass.

3)All non-private members/fields/methods/constructors are accessible in the subclass 
within the package.

4)Protected Members are accessible in all subclass.

5)  Java does not support multiple inheritances of classes ( Class A can extend at most 1 class)

6) In a class where no constructors are defined, a default constructor is implicitly 
provided(by the compiler).

7)Every subclass constructor before starting executions, first invokes the 
constructor of its immediate superclass. The default constructor of the user class is 
invoked implicitly unless specified otherwise.

8)We can use the keyword "super" to explicitly invoke an as the 1st 

9)Any non-final method in a super-class can be overridden in the subclass as long as 
you do not assign a weaker privilege/access.


10)An abstract class (defined using the keyword 'abstract') cannot be instantiated however 
they can be inherited. 

11)An abstract method is a method without a body,

12) An abstract method can only be written in an abstract class.

13)The subclass of an abstract class must override all abstract methods(if any) 

                            OR
                            
    The subclass must be declared 'abstract'.
    
    
14) An interface is a special type of abstract class where all the methods are by default 
    public and abstract.

    
15) When a class inherits an interface we use the keyword 'implements' (instead of extends)

16) A class that inherits an interface MUST override(implement) all the inherited methods.
    OR else the subclass becomes abstract.
    
17) A class can simultaneously extend another class and implement multiple interfaces 
   (multiple inheritances.)
